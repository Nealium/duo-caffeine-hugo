# Duo-Caffine-Hugo
A Hugo theme based on my vim colorscheme duo-caffeine, which itself was based off of an
atom syntax [no-caffeine-syntax](https://github.com/thomaslindstrom/no-caffeine-syntax)    

This was adapted from the [Lekh](https://github.com/ba11b0y/lekh.git) theme    
    
## Installation
1. Install [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)
2. Create Site `hugo new site {site_name}`
3. Add theme as submodule:
```bash
# Goto site root directory
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/Nealium/duo-caffeine-hugo.git themes/duo-caffeine
```
4. add `theme = duo-caffeine` in site config
